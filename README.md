This is an experimental project. I wanted to learn more about Typst's coding features so I delved into the Advent of Code exercises of 2024.

Of course, at some point, the execution time of each task got increasingly lengthy, ultimately prolonging the display in the pdf.

Be invited to copy the structure if you want to try it for yourself. 

Disclaimer: The first few days were completely or partially scripted by AI - I just wanted to see quickly if such a project could possibly work. However, many LLMs seem to have still problems with the rather young Typst language.
